# InventoryManagement
The InventoryManagementGUI.exe is located in a zip file called "EXE_IN_HERE.zip" in the release folder.
You will need to extract this InventoryManagementGUI.exeinto the release folder for the program to work. 
If you move the InventoryManagementGUI.exe to another folder the program will not run.

Windows might flag the exe as a virus, but we couldn't find a way around this.

The default login credentials are:
	Username: admin
	Password: password
You will need to enter these before you can use other features in the system.

In the "Testing, SRS, and Additional Documentation" folder we have supplied a Quick Start User Guide.
There you will find infomration regarding the use of the system.
